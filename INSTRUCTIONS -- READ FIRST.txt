Hello there.
Here's a short tutorial on how to use this shit. We dont have a gui wallet yet
so were stuck with the command line stuff (which actually isnt bad).

1. Clients:

Cryptotest.exe -Test if shit works
Nocoin-service.exe - Leave alone
wallet-api.exe - Leave alone 2
NoCoind.exe - Nocoin Deamon, your connection to the Nocoin network
NoWallet.exe - Wallet, needs deamon open to work.
NoWallet-beta.exe - Beta Wallet, interesting to know .wallet files of NoWallet and NoWallet-beta cant be mixed
miner.exe - Mines Nocoin, current blockreward ~175 Million $NOC


2. Important shit:

-To open your wallet you need to have your .wallet file in the folder

-When updating (downloading a new version and deleting the old folder) make sure to FIRST take your .wallet file
out and put it in the new folder.
If you delete your .wallet file your FUCKED
